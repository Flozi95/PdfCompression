# PdfCompression
Compress PDF documents with help of ITextSharp and FreeImage third party libs. 
Excellent point to start and customize for your particular cases

My experience was based on scanned documents mostly black-white.
This project could help you to compress files up to 

# Settings.
1. Setup at first parameters SourceFolder and DestinationFolder at App.config file.
2. FreeImage.dll should be added into "bin" directory manually, because Nuget doesn't want to copy main file into output directory.
